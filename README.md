🚀 AI-Powered CI/CD & Self-Healing DevOps Platform
What it is

A production-style DevOps & SRE platform that automates CI/CD, runs on Kubernetes, detects failures, analyzes root causes using AI-assisted logic, and performs safe self-healing actions.

What it demonstrates

Fail-fast CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)

Secure, reproducible Docker builds

Kubernetes operations (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, HPA)

Self-healing via probes, restarts, rollbacks, autoscaling

AI applied to incident analysis (RCA), not blind automation

Strong SRE mindset (reliability, recovery, explainability)
